# pythonVNAFMR
Python based data acquisition system for vector network analyser ferromagnetic resonance (VNAFMR) measurements

Vector network analyser performs a sweep of the frequency recording the transmitted RF power as a function of frequency.

This frequency sweep is repeated whilst applying a magnetic field to the sample.

The final data allows field-frequency maps of the absorption of a magnetic sample to be obtained, holding information about ferromagnetic resonances.
